    <p>
      After a browser is done transforming the markup's text to the DOM tree, 
      AngularJS kicks in and traverses the parsed DOM structure. <br>
      Each time it encounters a directive, AngularJS executes its logic to turn 
      directives into dynamic parts of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is almost similar to creating a new <em>domain-specific language</em><em> (<b>DSL</b>)</em> on top of HTML 
      and instructing a browser on how to make sense of the new instructions. <br>
      You can often hear that AngularJS "teaches browsers new tricks".
