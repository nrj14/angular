    <div>
      <p>In the entire AngularJS framework, there are only three events being emitted </p>
        <ol>
          <li>$includeContentRequested</li>
          <li>$includeContentLoaded</li>
          <li>$viewContentLoaded</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>And seven events being broadcasted :</p>
        <ol>
          
          <li>$locationChangeStart</li>
          <li>$locationChangeSuccess</li>
          <li>$routeUpdate</li>
          <li>$routeChangeStart</li>
          <li>$routeChangeSuccess</li>
          <li>$routeChangeError</li>
          <li>$destr</li>
        </ol> 
        As you can see, scope events are used very sparingly and we should evaluate other options 
        (mostly the two-way data binding) before ending custom events.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p> 
        We can listen to the <b>$locationChangeSuccess</b> event (broadcasted from the <b> $rootScope instance</b>) 
        to be notified whenever a location (URL in a browser) changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similar to the DOM events, we can call the <b>preventDefault()</b> and <b>stopPropagation()</b> methods on event object. 
        The <b>stopPropagation()</b> method call will prevent an event from bubbling up the scopes' hierarchy, 
        and is available only for events dispatched upwards in the hierarchy (<b>$emit</b>).
      </p>      
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      Don't try to mimic the DOM event-based programming model in AngularJS. <br>
      Most of the time there are better ways of structuring your application, and you can go very far with the two-way data binding.
